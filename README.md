## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook, thus this is a prerequisite.

There should be the following libraries installed to run the code:
 - pandas
 - matplotlib

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a project work for Udacity's Citizen Data Scientist nanodegree. In this project, I used Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand in my preferred region (UK, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary) the following:

1. What tech roles are out there on the market? (Assuming Stackoverflow represents the market well.)
2. What does career satisfaction look like among those professionals?
3. Where do bootcamp attendees work?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main analysis is encapsulated in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook file to showcase the work related to the project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The key findings are summarized in a blog post [here](https://medium.com/@attila.toth86/insights-from-stack-overflow-developer-survey-641a2d0c3f94).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Data is obtained from Udacity, originated from Stack Overflow. Licensing and other descriptive information about the dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
